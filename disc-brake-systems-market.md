<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disc Brake Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piston Type</li><li>Floating Caliper Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Disc brake systems come in two main types: piston type and floating caliper type. In piston type systems, the brake pads are pushed against the rotor by pistons located inside the caliper. This design allows for more precise brake control and better performance. Floating caliper type systems, on the other hand, have a single piston that moves within the caliper to apply pressure on both sides of the rotor. This design is simpler and generally more cost-effective, but may not offer the same level of performance as piston type systems.</p></p>
