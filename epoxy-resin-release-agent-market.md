<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Resin Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resin Mold Release Wax</li><li>Resin Mold Release Spray</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Epoxy resin release agents are commonly used in various industries to aid in the release of resin from molds. There are two main types of epoxy resin release agents - resin mold release wax and resin mold release spray. Resin mold release wax is a solid wax that is applied to the mold surface before pouring in the resin. Resin mold release spray, on the other hand, is a liquid spray that is applied onto the mold surface. Both types of release agents help to prevent the resin from sticking to the mold, allowing for easy removal.</p></p>
