<p><strong>The Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Pump Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I Diabetes</li><li>Type II Diabetes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Pump is commonly used in the management of both Type I and Type II Diabetes. In Type I Diabetes, where the body does not produce enough insulin, the pump provides a continuous supply of insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. In Type II Diabetes, where the body is unable to use insulin properly, the pump helps in maintaining stable blood sugar levels throughout the day. This application of the pump has led to its widespread use in the diabetes market.</p></p>
