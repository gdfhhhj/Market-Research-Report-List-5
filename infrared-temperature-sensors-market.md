<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Temperature Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared temperature sensors can be categorized into two main types: contact type and non-contact type. Contact type sensors require physical contact with the object to measure its temperature accurately. On the other hand, non-contact type sensors can measure temperature from a distance without any physical contact. The contact type sensors are generally more accurate and suitable for specific applications where precise temperature measurement is required, while non-contact type sensors are more convenient for measuring temperature from a distance or in hazardous environments.</p></p>
