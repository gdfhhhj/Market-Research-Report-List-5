<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB AOI Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inline</li><li>Offline</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PCB AOI Equipment market types can be categorized as Inline and Offline systems. Inline systems are integrated directly into the PCB production line, offering real-time inspection during the manufacturing process. This ensures immediate feedback and allows for quick corrections. On the other hand, Offline systems are separate from the production line and are typically used for post-production inspection. While they may not provide real-time feedback, they still offer accurate and thorough inspection of PCBs. Both types serve important roles in ensuring quality control in PCB manufacturing.</p></p>
