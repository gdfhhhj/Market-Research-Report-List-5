<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pomegranate Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray Drying Pomegranate Powder</li><li>Freeze-dried Pomegranate Powder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pomegranate powder is available in two main types in the market: spray-dried and freeze-dried. Spray-drying involves spraying a liquid form of pomegranate onto hot air, which quickly evaporates the moisture, leaving behind a powdered form. This method is cost-effective and results in a finer texture. On the other hand, freeze-drying involves freezing the pomegranate juice and then slowly removing the moisture through a vacuum, resulting in a powder with better color, flavor, and nutrient retention, albeit at a higher cost.</p></p>
