<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Acting Gas Boosters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage</li><li>Double Stage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Double acting gas boosters are available in two main types - single stage and double stage. Single stage gas boosters have one piston that compresses the gas in a single stroke, while double stage gas boosters have two pistons which provide a higher level of compression in two stages. Single stage gas boosters are suited for applications requiring moderate compression, while double stage gas boosters are ideal for applications requiring higher levels of compression. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different industrial applications based on the required compression levels.</p></p>
