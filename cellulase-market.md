<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EG</li><li>CBH</li><li>BG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cellulase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in breaking down cellulose into glucose. There are three main types of cellulase enzymes - endoglucanase (EG), cellobiohydrolase (CBH), and beta-glucosidase (BG). EG works by breaking down cellulose chains internally, CBH acts at the ends of the cellulose chain to release cellobiose units, and BG further converts cellobiose into glucose. Each type of enzyme plays a specific role in the cellulose degradation process, making them essential in various industries such as biofuels, textiles, and food production.</p></p>
