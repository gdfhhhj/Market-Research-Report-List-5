<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Elevator System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Holed Hydraulic</li><li>Holeless Hydraulic</li><li>Roped Hydraulic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Holed Hydraulic, Holeless Hydraulic, and Roped Hydraulic are all types of hydraulic elevator systems. Holed Hydraulic systems are installed with a piston and cylinder underneath the elevator cab, requiring a hole to be drilled in the ground. Holeless Hydraulic systems do not require a drilled hole, as the piston and cylinder are located beside the elevator shaft. Roped Hydraulic systems use ropes and a pulley system in addition to hydraulic power to move the elevator cab. Each type has its own advantages and is utilized in different applications.</p></p>
