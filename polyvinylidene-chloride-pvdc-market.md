<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyvinylidene Chloride (PVDC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isotactic</li><li>Atactic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyvinylidene Chloride (PVDC) is a polymer commonly used in packaging materials due to its excellent barrier properties against gases and moisture. There are two main types of PVDC markets based on the arrangement of the polymer chains: isotactic and atactic. Isotactic PVDC has a regular and orderly arrangement of chains, resulting in strong barrier qualities. In contrast, atactic PVDC has a disordered arrangement, leading to lower barrier performance. Both types have their own applications in the packaging industry based on their specific properties.</p></p>
