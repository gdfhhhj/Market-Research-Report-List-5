<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phenolic Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Phenolic Resin</li><li>Thermosetting Phenolic Resin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phenolic resins can be classified into two main types: thermoplastic phenolic resin and thermosetting phenolic resin. Thermoplastic phenolic resins can be melted and re-melted multiple times without causing degradation in their properties. On the other hand, thermosetting phenolic resins undergo a chemical reaction when exposed to heat or other curing agents, resulting in a hardened and insoluble material that cannot be reshaped. Each type of phenolic resin has its unique applications and benefits in various industries such as automotive, construction, and electronics.</p></p>
