<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IP Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP Camera</li><li>Decentralized IP Camera</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centralized IP cameras require a central network video recorder (NVR) to store and manage the video footage, making them suitable for larger installations where multiple cameras are needed. Decentralized IP cameras have built-in storage and intelligence, allowing them to operate independently without the need for an NVR. They are ideal for smaller installations or locations where a simplified setup is preferred. Both types offer high-quality video monitoring capabilities and can be easily integrated into existing network systems.</p></p>
