<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Clean Room Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Turbulently Ventilated</li><li>Unidirectional Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial clean rooms are classified based on the types of air flow they use to maintain cleanliness. Turbulently ventilated clean rooms rely on the circulation of air throughout the room to remove contaminants. On the other hand, unidirectional flow clean rooms have air flow that moves in a single direction, usually from ceiling to floor, to minimize the spread of contaminants. Both types of clean rooms are used in industries where strict cleanliness and contamination control are essential, such as pharmaceutical manufacturing and electronics assembly.</p></p>
