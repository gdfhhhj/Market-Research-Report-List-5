<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Developer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Type</li><li>Negative Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photoresist developer market consists of two main types: positive type and negative type. Positive type developers are used to dissolve unexposed areas of photoresist, leaving the exposed areas intact. This type of developer is ideal for creating intricate patterns and designs. Negative type developers, on the other hand, dissolve the exposed areas of photoresist, leaving the unexposed areas intact. This type is typically used for larger areas of uniform exposure. Both types play a crucial role in the semiconductor and electronics industries.</p></p>
