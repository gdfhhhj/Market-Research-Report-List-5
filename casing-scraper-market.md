<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Casing Scraper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Rotational</li><li>Rotational</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Casing scrapers are used in the oil and gas industry to remove debris, cement, and scale from the inside of casing pipes. Non-rotational casing scrapers are stationary tools that are lowered into the casing and pulled back up to clean the walls. Rotational casing scrapers, on the other hand, are attached to a rotational tool such as a drill string or coiled tubing, allowing for more efficient cleaning as the tool spins while being pulled up and down the casing. Both types serve the same purpose of maintaining clean and well-functioning casing pipes.</p></p>
