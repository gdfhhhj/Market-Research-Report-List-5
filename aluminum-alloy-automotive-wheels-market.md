<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Alloy Automotive Wheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forging Aluminum Alloy Wheels</li><li>Casting Aluminum Alloy Wheels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Forging aluminum alloy wheels are produced by shaping a solid block of aluminum using high temperature and pressure. This process results in wheels that are lightweight, strong, and have a high level of precision. On the other hand, casting aluminum alloy wheels are made by pouring molten aluminum into a mold and allowing it to cool and harden. While casting wheels are generally more affordable and easier to produce, they are not as strong or lightweight as forged wheels. Both types cater to different market segments based on their unique characteristics.</p></p>
